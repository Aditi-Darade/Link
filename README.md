## A Full-stack Linktree clone | 
- Used Google cloud computing service for data storage and requesting consent from users to access their data through client ID and secret. 
- Used MongoDB to store data in a database such as user information, user accounts, and login sessions. Each client's data is saved in a file and sent to the backend API which is then saved on a S3 bucket on AWS.
- Developed an analytics page that shows users the number of views on their page as well as clicks on each of their links which is displayed as a line chart.
  
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
